Payment Integration: Stripe API
Project Structure:
Organize your project into directories like pages, components, api, and prisma.
Use Next.js’s App Router for navigation.
Environment Variables:
Set up environment variables (e.g., .env.local) for sensitive data (API keys, database credentials, etc.).
Pages
Home Page (SSR):
Display featured dishes, promotions, and restaurant details.
